# Recon88.sh
Making a script to automate reconnaissance. This script only works in Kali because of the commands to install some of the programs, if you want to use it in a different environment you'll have to change those commands. This is for my Bootcon final project and not intended for malicious purposes. 

You will need to make a Shodan.io account and get your API key.
Next you will need a target domain.
Your command to execute this script will look like this:
'sudo ./recon88.sh <URL> <API_KEY>
Example: sudo ./recon88.sh example.com kejjbdrkdrnbdnk
